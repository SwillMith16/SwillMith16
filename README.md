## My Ambition

 - Aspiring Unity Game Developer
 - Collaborate with a team to create fun, well-produced games
 - Work for/with a game studio to develop the latest hit games


## My Progress

I began Unity development in September 2022 with my first game Pong2D, which you can find in my repo's. I moved onto 3D games and collaborating with a team of friends at Uni to immerse myself in a more dynamic development environment and to adapt to what a job in game development would really be like.
