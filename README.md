## My Ambition

 - Aspiring Unity Game Developer
 - Collaborate with a team to create fun, well-produced games
 - Work for/with a game studio to develop the latest hit games
 
Currently I am collaborating with a team of developers at my university to produce our first group project Unity game. It's relatively small scale and a first for all of us. I'm always open to collaboration and any useful hints and tips that people may want to offer. While I haven't had the typical kind of education pathway that you would expect for a game developer, I'm really excited to learn and apply my thinking and learning skills to game development.


## My Background
 - Undertaking a Bachelors Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering
 - Digital Electronics and Microprocessor Systems
 - App Development in C++
